# gr-crystal
Crystal API for GR framework

A (still incomplete) interface to GR framework from Crystal


## Installation

You need to place grlib.cr

You also need to install GR in the standard way.

grlib.cr assumes that  @[Link("GR")] works. That means all necessary
libraries from GR must be in the search pass of your ld. 

## Getting started

Download grsample.cr and

   crystal grsample.cr

should show simple plot.
